# Sandie
Sandie is a straightforward API wrapper for the [eval.so](http://eval.so/) [API](http://eval.so/api). Eval.so is a sandboxed code evaluation platform which namely support C#, Ruby, Python, Lua, and even Java!

*Notably, some parts of the API may note work as expected; if so this isn't Sandie's fault. In addition to providing a nice Ruby layer to the eval.so API, this project will also test various supported languages from the API.*

## Installation
Install it as `gem install sandie`. Or if you're using Bundler, add `gem 'sandie'` to your Gemfile, and then `bundle`.
